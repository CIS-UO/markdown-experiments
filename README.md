Experiments with assistive customization for Github-flavored markdown

{{ site.var }}

This is, so far at least, a failed experiment.
While github pages uses the Jekyll static site
generator, which (according to documentation) uses
the _liquid_ template engine, this does not seem to
be the case for markdown files in an ordinary
Github repository.
